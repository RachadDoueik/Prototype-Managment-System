# Prototypes Management System

## Overview
The **Prototypes Management System** is a Java-based application developed for **Omega**, a company focused on managing and tracking prototype projects. The system features a Java Swing interface that allows users to manage prototypes, filter tasks, processes, and resources, and simulate project costs. Data is stored persistently on disk using object serialization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prototypes-management-system.git
   cd prototypes-management-system



## Usage
- Use the Java Swing interface to create, manage, and delete prototypes and related tasks.
- Simulate project costs and monitor resources as tasks and processes are added.
- Filter projects by tasks, tasks by processes, and processes by resources.
- Data is automatically saved to disk and loaded when the application restarts.



## Features
- Create and manage prototypes for electrical appliances projects.
- Track tasks, processes, and resources (costs, durations , resource usage).
- Simulate project costs in real time.
- Filter projects by tasks, tasks by processes, and processes by resources.
- Data persistence via object serialization on disk.
- User-friendly interface built with Java Swing.
  


## Technologies Used
- Java Swing: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the application.
- Java I/O: Handles object serialization and file storage for saving project data.



## Data Storage
All project data is stored in serialized form on disk. The application automatically loads data from these files when it starts up and saves changes to them as you use the application.
